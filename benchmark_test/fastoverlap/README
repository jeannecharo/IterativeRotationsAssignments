This directory contains the software fastoverlap,
originally published in the work referenced in the file original_ref.bib.
We include the zip file downloaded from their github repository at:
  https://github.com/matthewghgriffiths/fastoverlap
which was obtained on 7th July 2021.

The other file included here is is the file containing some modification that we
have done in order to run the software as we need.

 - sphericalAlignment_modread.py:
     The main routine with modificatins to input file reading.



The modification done:

  - input file reading:
     Originally, the files read by the main are:
       pos1 = readFile(os.path.join(datafolder, 'coords'))
       pos2 = readFile(os.path.join(datafolder, 'finish'))

     These have been modified to be:
       pos1 = readFile('temp_in.dat')
       pos2 = readFile('temp_random.dat')

  - output:
     Last part of the main function, which is:
       'testing alignment on randomly generated data, distance should ~ 0'
     has been commented, since it is not needed.


TO RUN:
 In order to run the fastoverlap software, unzip the fastoverlap-master.zip,

   unzip fastoverlap-master.zip
 
 Then copy the file sphericalAlignment_modread.py provided here to the main 
 folder of fastoverlap. That should be /fastoverlap-master/fastoverlap:
 
   cp sphericalAlignment_modread.py fastoverlap-master/fastoverlap

 If you change these paths, modify the run_single.sh script accordingly.

 Alternatively, you can download and install the
 full software from link provided in the original work:
