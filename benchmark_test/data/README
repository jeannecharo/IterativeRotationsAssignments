Each .tar.gz file contains a directory with the original data as downloaded,
 and a file called "original_ref.bib" which contains the original reference
 of the published work.

Whenever needed, a parser was written to transform the original data into xyz
format files, one structure per file. The parser is in each subdirectory 
called "parser", and the directory called "xyz" contains the 
structure files written in the .xyz format.

To untar, run for each filename.tar.gz:

   tar -xzf filename.tar.gz
